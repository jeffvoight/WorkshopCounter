DISCLAIMER:
This project is written with intentional defects and significant inefficiencies in order to demonstrate
software profiling.

If you see bugs, congratulations. It does, in fact, have bugs. It's supposed to.

By the way, every bug and inefficiency in this code is taken from real life. These are all lines of code
that I have seen in production *many* times.
